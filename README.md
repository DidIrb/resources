# Resources

I originally intended on making this a repository of information that is useful to developers only, more like a blog,
So to account for things beyond software development I am creating a website that will contain useful resources, from 
- Education material, 
- Tools
- Technologies
- Websites
- Applications
- Blogs
- Repositories

Basically anything I find helpful.

## Technology

React, TypeScript, Express, JSON server, shadcn ui.
This is a full stack application, and the back end code is available here.
